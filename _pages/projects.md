## 🚀 **Projects Across the Tech Universe**

### **ReQuillify: Automated Assessment Artifact Extraction Platform**
Designed and implemented an automation platform to extract, consolidate, and securely deliver Canvas LMS SpeedGrader artifacts as canonical, UCF-ID–mapped PDFs. Reduced grading turnaround time from 30–40 minutes to 2–3 minutes per student and eliminated manual retrieval errors. This work resulted in a peer-reviewed ASEE 2026 publication.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, Playwright (Chromium), MCP Automation, Canvas LMS, PDF Processing, HTML/CSS

### **Multi-LLM Analytics Pipeline for AI Proficiency Assessment**
Developed a scalable NLP analytics pipeline integrating multiple LLMs, sentence embeddings, unsupervised topic modeling, and statistical visualization to assess AI proficiency, adoption depth, and workforce readiness across graduate cohorts. Submitted as a peer-reviewed academic abstract.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, LLMs (Mistral, Qwen, LLaMA), NLP, Sentence Embeddings, Topic Modeling (NMF), Pandas, Matplotlib

### **Machine Learning–Driven Cricket Analysis and Match Outcome Prediction**
Analyzed IPL Cricket match data (2008–2024) to clean, visualize, and engineer features, then built and compared logistic regression,
Random forest, Gradient boosting, and XGBoost models, achieving 74.5% accuracy to predict match winners and guide team and
stakeholder decisions.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Machine Learning Algorithms, Sci-kit, Kaggle, Folium, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### **Scala-Based ETL Processing with Maven and PostgreSQL**
Designed and implemented an ETL pipeline using Scala and Maven to process and refine large-scale datasets, substantially increasing
processing efficiency and optimizing data retrieval performance with PostgreSQL.

- **Tech Stack**: Scala, Maven, PostgreSQL,IntelliJ

### **Microservices CRUD Application (In Progress)**
Developing a microservices-based application with CRUD operations. Dockerized services and Kubernetes will be used to ensure scalable deployment.

- **Tech Stack**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Microservices, Docker, Kubernetes

### 🌌 **Pipeline Automation with Apache Airflow**
Developed an automated ETL pipeline system using Apache Airflow to streamline data extraction, transformation, and loading into SQL databases. The workflow included rigorous data validation, cleaning, and scheduling, ensuring high efficiency and timely data processing through Airflow’s Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

- **Tech Stack**: Apache Airflow, Python, SQL, REST API

### 🌌 **Full-Stack Application with Spring Boot and React**
Built a comprehensive full-stack application using Java, Spring Boot, and ReactJS. Designed with Material UI and Ant Design, the application includes robust backend APIs and a user-friendly, responsive front-end interface, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.

- **Tech Stack**: Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, ReactJS, Material UI, Ant Design, Bootstrap

### 🛰️ **JSON Data Parser**
Engineered a JSON data parsing solution with Jackson JSON Parser for seamless conversion between JSON and Java objects. Optimized for complex data scenarios and large JSON datasets, the parser handles nested structures and enables efficient data manipulation with the Jackson Streaming API.

- **Tech Stack**: Java, Jackson JSON Parser, Maven

### 🌠 **Text-to-Speech Generating System**
Created a Python-based Text-to-Speech system using Kivy, which transforms text, images, and files into speech across multiple languages. Integrated gTTS API for text-to-audio conversion, Google Translator for multilingual support, and PyTesseract for OCR, allowing text extraction from images.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, Kivy, gTTS API, Google Translate, PyTesseract, Python Imaging Library (PIL)

### 🪐 **E-Commerce Web App (Online Book Store)**
Developed a dynamic online book store web application, featuring user authentication, genre categorization, and a responsive design for enhanced user experience. Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app provides smooth navigation and interaction for users.

- **Tech Stack**: Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL
